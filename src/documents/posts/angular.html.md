Admit it, your javascript is a mess.

I don't blame you. Javascript is a language of amuture. script kiddies at the 90' copy pasted

cappy code into crappy websites and it somehow worked. the trend continued throw the new millenuim and up until 
now everyone ignore that toy language.
in the last few years Javascript raised to a new super power level. it's EVERYWHERE.
